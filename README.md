# homecare-project

Our Application, 'HomeCare' is an interactive app to pair privately practicing nurses with patients in need of care at their own homes.

Patients' family members are able to view updates on the status of their relative which are provided by the nurse(s) who is/are caring for their family member.

Nurses are able to view the medical needs and schedules of each of the patients to which they are assigned and post private updates about their visits with each patient.
 
A superuser administrator is able to register new nurses/patients, and make assignments of which patients are seen by which nurses.
